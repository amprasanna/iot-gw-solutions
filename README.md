This is a sample client for Intel Gateway Solutions for the IoT development kits

Using the this code and the recipe [Connect an Intel® IoT Gateway to IBM Watson IoT Platform
](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/connect-an-intel-iot-gateway-to-iot-foundation/) listed on https://developer.ibm.com/iot/recipes/, you can quickly showcase how one can connect a Intel IoT Gateway to IBM Watson IoT Platform (WIoTP).

All one needs to do, is to, run a python script which actually sends the cpu utilisation data to the IBM Watson IoT Platform service at http://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com

Refer to the section [Conclusion and other related decipes](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/connect-an-intel-iot-gateway-to-iot-foundation/) in the Watson IoT Recipe [Connect an Intel® IoT Gateway to IBM Watson IoT Platform](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/connect-an-intel-iot-gateway-to-iot-foundation/) that details out on the next set of IoT Recipes that can be followed, to pursue and continue your work, exploring ways to play with IoT Gateway's.
